## Motivation

This project began with a desire to apply some technical skills to the labor movement in the United States. I have been inspired by the many union wins in higher education, the union leadership reform movements in the Teamsters and the UAW, and the upcoming strike possibility at UPS with the Teamsters. 

I had seen Cornell's Labor Action Tracker (LAT) before, but I wanted to make something slightly different showing how many strikes are happening per state at a given time. This is somewhat captured in the LAT, but I believe the point of that project is to create a centralized database and show more specific information than what I was thinking of. 

## Technical Details

I chose to use Python to gather the data from the LAT and to produce my final map. I have done some previous passion projects in Python webscraping.
